# Simple Chat
 Command line chat server and client written in Python and using Docker, made off of a tutorial from:

### Docker

Go into the root directory of this project and if you run:
```
docker-compose up
``` 
that should build it all out.
You'll need to run at least two separate terminals, one for the server and one for the client,
but you should be able to open up multiple clients. While on Ubuntu I was able to open up
three clients at a time.
